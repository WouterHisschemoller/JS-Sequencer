# JS-Sequencer
Web Audio online music sequencer in Javascript.

## Note
This project is far from finished and even quite some distance from being usable. I've paused development for now but might pick it up again later because I still like the idea of this app.

## Description
A music application consisting of:
* Audio plugin system
* Mixer with solo, mute, panorama and level
* UI with mouse / touch controls for plugin and mixer parameters.
* 16 step pattern sequencer
* Bank of 16 patterns
* Song mode to chain patterns
